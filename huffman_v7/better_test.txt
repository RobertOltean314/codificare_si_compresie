Hello World! This is a test file for Huffman compression.
It contains several lines of text to provide enough data for meaningful compression.
The Huffman algorithm works better with more data because it can identify patterns.
Let's add some repeated characters: AAAAAAAAAA BBBBBBBBBB CCCCCCCCCC
And some repeated words: compression compression compression
This file should give us good compression statistics to display.
Total file size should be large enough to show proper file size formatting.
